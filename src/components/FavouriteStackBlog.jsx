          <p>
            Over the past year of building modern web apps, I‚Äôve discovered a
            perfect combination of tools that make both design and development
            an absolute joy. Whether I‚Äôm working on a dashboard, a test portal,
            or a portfolio ‚Äî the combination of <strong>Shadcn/UI</strong>,{" "}
            <strong>Framer Motion</strong>, <strong>React Icons</strong>, and
            backends like <strong>MongoDB</strong> and <strong>Supabase</strong>{" "}
            has become my go-to tech stack.
          </p>

          <p>
            These tools help me create UIs that not only look great but feel
            natural, smooth, and interactive ‚Äî while also being easy to
            maintain. Let‚Äôs dive into why I love each part of this stack.
          </p>

          <img
            src={shadcn}
            alt="Shadcn UI Components"
            className="rounded-2xl my-6 w-full shadow-md"
          />

          <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">
            1. Shadcn/UI ‚Äî The Modern UI Foundation
          </h2>
          <p>
            <strong>Shadcn/UI</strong> has completely changed how I build user
            interfaces. It‚Äôs built on top of <strong>Radix UI</strong> and{" "}
            <strong>Tailwind CSS</strong>, which means everything is accessible,
            flexible, and developer-friendly. The best part is that the
            components are <em>copied into your project</em>, giving full
            control and no dependency lock-ins.
          </p>
          <p>
            From buttons and dialogs to dropdowns and cards ‚Äî Shadcn offers
            everything I need for a clean, professional design system. Combined
            with Tailwind‚Äôs utility classes, I can create consistent UI faster
            than ever.
          </p>

          {/* Image 2 */}
          <img
            src={motion}
            alt="Framer Motion Animations"
            className="rounded-2xl my-6 w-full shadow-md"
          />

          <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">
            2. Framer Motion ‚Äî Bringing Life to Components
          </h2>
          <p>
            I can‚Äôt imagine UI without <strong>Framer Motion</strong>. It‚Äôs the
            secret ingredient that adds soul to my interfaces. With a few lines
            of code, I can create smooth transitions, micro-interactions, and
            page animations that make the app feel dynamic and alive.
          </p>
          <p>
            The best thing is how well it blends with React. Whether it‚Äôs a card
            fade-in, a sliding modal, or a glowing hover effect ‚Äî Motion makes
            everything feel intuitive and elegant.
          </p>

          <img

            className="rounded-2xl my-6 w-full shadow-md"
          />

          <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">
            3. React Icons ‚Äî Simple Yet Powerful
          </h2>
          <p>
            I use <strong>React Icons</strong> in almost every project. It‚Äôs the
            easiest way to include icons from popular sets like{" "}
            <strong>Font Awesome</strong>, <strong>Feather</strong>,{" "}
            <strong>Lucide</strong>, and more ‚Äî all within React components.
            Icons play a major role in UI clarity, and this library keeps my
            workflow efficient.
          </p>

          {/* Image 4 */}
          <img
            src={mongodb}
            alt="MongoDB Dashboard"
            className="rounded-2xl my-6 w-full shadow-md"
          />

          <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">
            4. MongoDB ‚Äî The Scalable Backend Engine
          </h2>
          <p>
            <strong>MongoDB</strong> has become my favorite choice for handling
            backend data. It‚Äôs fast, flexible, and document-based ‚Äî which means
            I can structure my data in a way that matches real-world
            applications. With <strong>MongoDB Atlas</strong>, I can host and
            scale databases in the cloud without worrying about setup or
            maintenance.
          </p>
          <p>
            I usually connect MongoDB to my React apps through an Express or
            Next.js API route, allowing me to build full-stack applications that
            feel seamless and efficient.
          </p>

          {/* Image 5 */}
          <img
            src={supabse}
            alt="Supabase Dashboard"
            className="rounded-2xl my-6 w-full shadow-md"
          />

          <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">
            5. Supabase ‚Äî The Open-Source Powerhouse
          </h2>
          <p>
            When I need more control or SQL power, I switch to{" "}
            <strong>Supabase</strong>. It‚Äôs like Firebase but open-source, with
            a PostgreSQL database, authentication, file storage, and API built
            in. The dashboard is clean, the setup is fast, and the developer
            experience is excellent.
          </p>

          <p>
            It integrates perfectly with React and Next.js, making it ideal for
            projects that might grow into something big later.
          </p>

          {/* Outro */}
          <p>
            These tools together make my workflow smooth, fast, and scalable. I
            can focus on design and logic ‚Äî not fighting with configuration.
            Whether I‚Äôm building personal projects or client work, this stack
            gives me everything I need to bring ideas to life beautifully.
          </p>

          <p>
            If you‚Äôre starting a new React project, I highly recommend trying
            this combination. It‚Äôs modern, modular, and built for speed.
          </p>

          <p>
            Here‚Äôs to crafting smooth UIs, fluid motion, and rock-solid backends
            ‚Äî all powered by tools that truly inspire developers like me. üöÄ
