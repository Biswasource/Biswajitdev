            I‚Äôm incredibly proud to share that UIvault  ‚Äî our
            open-source UI component library ‚Äî has officially crossed{" "}
          11,000 active users worldwide! What began as a
            weekend experiment has evolved into a powerful developer tool,
            helping thousands of creators design modern, elegant, and accessible
            interfaces with ease.
          </p>

          <p>
            Built with React and Tailwind CSS,
            UIvault combines speed, flexibility, and aesthetics into one unified
            system. Every component is engineered to perfection ‚Äî responsive by
            default, beautifully animated, and easy to customize. Whether it‚Äôs
            glowing cards, motion-driven accordions, or sleek pricing grids,
            UIvault empowers developers to bring ideas to life in seconds.

          />

          <p>
            Building UIvault has been one of the most rewarding journeys of my
            development career. I owe a huge part of this success to my friend{" "}
            <strong>Biswabhusan</strong>, whose creative insights, UI sense, and
            constant support have shaped UIvault into what it is today. Every
            feature and component is a reflection of teamwork, passion, and
            shared curiosity for great design.
          </p>

          <p>
            The beauty of UIvault lies in its simplicity. Developers can start
            using it instantly with a single command:
          </p>

          <pre className="bg-gray-100 text-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg cl">
            npx ui-vault@latest add card
          </pre>

          <p>
            From there, choose your preferred format (JSX or TSX), select a
            theme like <em>NeonPulse</em>, <em>Obsidian</em>, or{" "}
            <em>AuroraGlow</em>, and instantly import your component. UIvault
            automatically handles installation, dependencies, and styling ‚Äî
            saving valuable development time while maintaining consistency and
            beauty across your project.

          />
